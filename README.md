This repository contains games/scripts developed by me for teaching python to the childeren and showing them the wonders of programming.
## Arcade Game
This folder contains a simple game made in Python Arcade. It is inspired from the official examples for the Python Arcade. It focuses on showing the basic functionalities of the arcade along with highlighting the power of programming. 

It involves a single robot which has to *collect* bad robots to become more powerful and eventually win the game.
